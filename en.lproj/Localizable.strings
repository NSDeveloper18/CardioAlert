Monitoring of the condition after previous heart diseases and surgical interventions:\n - After a myocardial infarction.\n - After heart surgery.\n\n4. Evaluation of the effectiveness of therapy:\n - Taking antiarrhythmic drugs.\n - Monitoring the treatment of hypertension and other heart diseases.\n\n5.

Technical difficulties:\n - Skin diseases or injuries in the places where the electrodes are applied (for example, burns, severe eczema).\n - Severe obesity, which can make it difficult to apply electrodes.\n\n2. Mental states:\n - Uncontrolled behavior of the patient, strong excitement or fear.\n\nAn ECG is an important tool in cardiology that allows you to detect various heart diseases at an early stage and monitor their treatment.";
